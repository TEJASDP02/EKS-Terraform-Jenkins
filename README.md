**Proof of Concept (PoC) on Terraform, Kubernetes(EKS) and CI/CD**

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this POC is to demonstrate automated infrastructure deployment using Terraform, Jenkins, and Amazon EKS. The project provisions an EC2 instance with Jenkins server installed, which then automates the deployment of an EKS cluster and a WordPress application. This setup showcases the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines for efficient, scalable, and repeatable cloud deployments.

**1.2 Scope** 

The PoC will cover the following:

* Provision and manage AWS infrastructure, including EC2, VPC, EKS, and S3, to deploy and scale a WordPress application on an EKS cluster using Terraform and Jenkins

### **1.3 Objectives**

* Confirm Terraformâ€™s ability to provision and manage AWS resources, including EC2, VPC, and EKS clusters.  
* Illustrate Jenkins role in CI/CD, automating the deployment of applications, specifically a WordPress setup, on an EKS cluster .

## **2\. Terraform, Jenkins and EKS**

* Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool that enables users to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language.  
* Jenkins automates the CI/CD pipeline, facilitating the build, test, and deployment of applications through customizable pipelines and integrations. It supports automation across various stages of software development, improving efficiency and consistency.  
*  Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes. It handles the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus on application development and operations.

## **3\. PoC Approach**

### **3.1 Infrastructure Resources(or) services**

**For Jenkins Server:**

* **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud with public subnets, and automatic public IP assignment on launch.  
* **Public Subnets**: Public subnets within the VPC, tagged as "jenkins-subnet."  
* **Security Group**: A security group for the Jenkins server with ingress rules allowing HTTP (port 8080\) and SSH (port 22\) from any IP, and egress rules allowing all traffic.  
* **EC2 Instance:** An EC2 instance named "Jenkins-Server" with the specified instance type, associated with the Jenkins security group, deployed in a public subnet, and configured with a Jenkins installation script.	

#### **For EKS:**

* **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud.  
* **Public Subnets**: Public subnets within the VPC, **Private Subnets**: Private subnets within the VPC  
* **NAT Gateway**: A single NAT gateway for the VPC.  
* **EKS Cluster**: An Amazon EKS cluster with public endpoint access.  
* **EKS Managed Node Group**: An Amazon EKS managed node group with `t2.small` instance type, configured with minimum, maximum, and desired sizes of 1, 3, and 2 nodes respectively


### **3.2 Terraform Setup**

**Install Terraform**:

* Install terraform on your local machine:- [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)

### **3.3 Cloning the Repo**

* Repo clone:- open your terminal and run this command:-   
                 **git clone [https://github.com/TEJASDP02/EKS-Terraform-Jenkins.git](https://github.com/TEJASDP02/EKS-Terraform-Jenkins.git)**
